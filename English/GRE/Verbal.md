# Prefix, suffixes and stem

https://onlineteachersuk.com/prefixes-and-suffixes/

## Introduction

A prefix is a group of letters added to the beginning of a word. It can change the meaning or the function of the word. For example, the prefix un- can make a word negative or opposite, such as un happy or un do.

A suffix is a group of letters added to the end of a word. It can change the word class or the tense of the word. For example, the suffix -ed can make a verb past tense, such as walk ed or play ed.

A stem is the part of the word that remains after removing the prefix or suffix. It usually contains the main meaning of the word. For example, the stem of un happy is happy, and the stem of walk ed is walk.

Some words have both a prefix and a suffix, such as un comfort able. The stem of this word is comfort, which means a state of ease or well-being. The prefix un- makes it negative, meaning not comfortable. The suffix -able makes it an adjective, meaning able to be.

Understanding how words are formed using prefixes and suffixes can help you expand your vocabulary and improve your spelling. You can also learn some common word families that share the same prefixes or suffixes.


## Prefix
The prefix <font color="#ff0000">a-</font> means "to" or "toward". It comes from the Latin preposition ad, which has the same meaning. The prefix a- can also be used to modify or emphasize the meaning of the stem.

The prefix <font color="#ff0000">de-</font> means "down, off, away, from among, down from" or "completely". It comes from the Latin preposition de, which has the same meaning. The prefix de- can also be used to undo or reverse a verb's action, or to negate or oppose it.


## Stem
The stem <font color="#ff0000">men-</font> means "to project" or "to threaten". It comes from the Latin verb minare, which means "to drive (cattle) with shouts" or "to menace". The stem men- can also be related to words that mean "mountain", "mouth", or "neck".

The stem is <font color="#ff0000">-astis-</font>, which means "to punish" or "to correct". It comes from the Latin verb castigare, which means "to chastise, correct, punish" or "to purify, refine". The noun castus means "pure" or "chaste".

## Suffix
The suffix <font color="#ff0000">-able</font> means "able to be" or "having the quality of". It comes from the Latin suffix -abilis, which has the same meaning. The suffix -able can also be used to form adjectives from verbs or nouns.
