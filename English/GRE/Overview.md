# Math

Question types
- Numeric entry
- Data interpretation
- Multiple-answer question
- Five-answer multiple choice

Pay attention to the type of numbers, like $6<N<10$ and $N$ is not an odd integer, but actually $N$ is not a integer, it can be fraction. 

# Verbal
[[Verbal]]
## Structure

In general, questions in verbal section will be easier and easier. But in text completion part, the question may be harder and harder. So I can skip some of them.
- Text Completion
- Setence Equivalence
- Reading Comprehensive
- Paragraph Argument(included in reading comprehensive, may be difficult)


# General Strategy

## Skipping questions and pacing

Keep in mind that every question is worth the same number of points. So, do the questions that I find easy.

But the quantitative comparison question goes harder and harder.
Also, the text completion question goes harder too. Maybe I need to skip it.
In reading comprehensive part, there is a long one and a short one, I can finish the shorter one first.
