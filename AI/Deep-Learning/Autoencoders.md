Autoencoder is a neural network that is trained to attempt to copy its input tp its output. Internally, a hidden layer $h$ is used to present the inut with a code. There are two parts in autoencoder: an encoder that maps x to $h$ with function $f$, $h=f(x)$; a decoder that produce a representation $r$ : $r=g(h)$.
