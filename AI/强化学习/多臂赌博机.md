# 问题描述

There are  k  options (actions):  $\mathcal{A}:=\left\{a_{1}, a_{2}, \cdots, a_{k}\right\}$ 
- At time  $t(t=0,1,2, \cdots)$  : select an action  $A_{t} \in \mathcal{A}$  and a reward  $R_{t} \sim \mathcal{D}\left(A_{t}\right)$  is received, where  $\mathcal{D}(\cdot)$  is a stationary probability distribution.
Then, we can obtain a sequence of data:  $A_{0}, R_{0}, A_{1}, R_{1}, A_{2}, R_{2}, \cdots$
